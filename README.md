# Reader
Simple program that reads a text file and returns the total of the numbers found in that file (only working with integers for the moment)
Example of text file: 

CPU 150 
GPU 279 
RAM 100

The reader program will split the text and find the integers and calculate the total. 
The text format should be in like in example above: first the text, blank space and after that the numbers.
